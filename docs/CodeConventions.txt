The following should be a minimum convention for how to write the code in Happah. All aspects listed here are still to be discussed:

Variables:
- Constant variables are written in upper-case with underscores between each word.
- All non-constant variables are written in camel-case.
- All class variables should begin with an underscore (_). All method parameters should not.
- Variable names should begin with a non-capital letter.
- No class variables should be public.

Classes:
- Class names begin with a capital letter and proceed in camel-case (except for main).
- Class file names have the same form as their names and use the endings .h and .cpp.

Methods:
- Method names begin with non-capital letters and continue in camel-case.
- Getters and Setters should be used whenever possible.

Braces:
- Opening braces should be placed in the same line as the method declaration (K & R style).

Pointers:
- The pointer symbol (*) should be placed after the type and not after the variable declaration.
