The following should be a minimum convention for how to write the code in Happah. All aspects listed here are still to be discussed:

Variables:
- All non-final variables are written in camel-case.
- All class variables should begin with an underscore (_). All method parameters should not.
- Variable names should begin with a non-capital letter.

Classes:
- Class names should begin with a capital letter and proceed in camel-case (except for main).
